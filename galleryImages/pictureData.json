He worked with Halsey Davidson of the Detroit advertising firm Campbell Ewald. Writing his memoirs in 1966, Helck described this campaign as one of his most rewarding commissions:</p>  <p style=\"padding: 5px 40px;text-align: left;\"><i>... before I could plunge into this formidable job [writing and illustrating his book \"The Checkered Flag\"] there was a Chevrolet Truck painting, the 35th of that lengthy series, which had to meet an April 15th deadline, after which all pay work would end until the book was finished. But also facing me was the necessity of explaining my withdrawal from Chevrolet to Halsey Davidson, top art director at Campbell-Ewald Advertising of Detroit.  That understanding fellow gave his blessing to my book project. Not only had Halsey and I worked together on Chevie for ten years, but also under his aegis I had produced twenty-four paintings for National Steel concurrently with the Chevie campaign. In most assignments I had utmost freedom in choice of subject and location, provided the specified truck model was shown doing its stuff.  I'm bound to say that over the years my affiliation with Halsey Davidson has been just about my most rewarding experience in advertising art. We are still good friends.</i></p>  <p style=\"padding: 5px 20px;text-align: left;\">Reviewing Peter Helck's work log reveals that he actually did 36 paintings for Chevy. 10 of these were single page ads for which he was paid $2,500 each, the rest were larger, wide enough for double page ads, for which he was paid $3,500 each. However, many of these doubles also appeared as heavily cropped single page ads.</p>  <p style=\"padding: 5px 20px;text-align: left;\">Only a few of these paintings are known to have survived. In 2011 I was contacted by the daughters of a man who had worked for Campbell Ewald.  Years previously this man had rescued three of the Chevy Truck paintings that were being thrown away. These are the only survivng originals from this series that I know about. (If anybody knows of others, please let me know.) </p>","pictures":[{"imageFile":"1949_triangle","fileSizes":{"th":"1","reg":"1","lg":"1"},"title":"Chevy Truck Ad: Payload Leaders","medium":"Casein or Gouache on Illustration Board","description":"\"Roadside Diner\" Delivered Jan. 17, 1950.
